## Quality of the data 
This Study makes use of  the EM-DAT which is the only one of the three disaster databases that is publicly available (the other two disaster datasets are NatCat 
and Sigma) and are not available for public access (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002)

 As (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002) point out in their analysis of disaster data sets that recording the occurrences of disasters, the impact they have on infrastructure and the economy and the affected population "remains patchy". There is not standardised methodology of definitions of data collection methods. Furthermore no single institution has taken responsibility for being the provider of verified disaster data (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002).

From the analysis conducted by (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002) we note the following important conclusions with respect to how the EM-DAT could be used for this analysis. The most important conclusion for this study is that " the difference in databases reduced significantly with time" (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002, p. 15). Furthermore they noted that records from the 1980's had more discrepancies than those from the 1990's and later years leading them to conclude that there was increasing consistency and commonality between the datasets (Guha-Sapir, D and Below, R, 2002).

Therefor based on the conclusions and the inconsistencies, lack of completeness, standardisation we will limit the dataset to only records from 1980 onwards. In addition we add the caveat that while we have chosen a cut off point it must be borne in mind that even the data from post 1980, while improved is not perfect. 

Box in (Harvard Business Review, 2018, p. 15) stated that "All models are wrong, but some are useful" and on this basis conclude that for this analysis only the disaster records from 1980 onwards are retained, since keeping the dataset from 1900 with all the inconsistencies, incomplete records will adversely skew and mar the forecast. It is accepted that this model will be wrong but hope it will be useful.
